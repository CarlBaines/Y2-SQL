I had to build a program that creates a database for fish. It allows the user to enter fish values into the database, such as the name of the fish, the species of the fish and the tank number. It also allows the user to search for the name of a fish held in the database and it will print all data that is associated with it. Furthermore, the program also allows the user to print all data that is held in the database/table.
